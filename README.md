## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a personalized voice assistant system that adapts its speech characteristics based on user preferences and context. The system uses text-to-speech technology combined with machine learning techniques to create a more engaging and personalized user experience.

Key features:
- User profile management
- Context-aware speech adaptation
- Adaptive learning to improve personalization over time
- Speech synthesis with simulated voice characteristic adjustments

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-voice-assistant.git
   cd personalized-voice-assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Note: The `data/` directory is not included in the repository but will be generated when running the mock data generation script.

## Component Descriptions

1. **generate_mock_data.py**: Creates mock datasets for user preferences, context samples, and sample dialogues. This simulates real-world data for testing and development purposes.

2. **user_profiling.py**: Manages user profiles, including loading, creating, and updating user preferences such as pitch, speed, and voice gender.

3. **context_analysis.py**: Analyzes the current context (e.g., time of day, location, activity) to make recommendations for speech characteristics.

4. **speech_synthesizer.py**: Handles text-to-speech conversion using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). It applies personalization by simulating adjustments to voice characteristics based on user preferences and context.

5. **adaptive_synthesizer.py**: Implements an adaptive learning mechanism that adjusts user preferences based on simulated user feedback, aiming to improve personalization over time.

6. **personalization_evaluation.py**: Evaluates the performance of the personalization system by simulating multiple users and interactions.

## Mock Data Generation

The `generate_mock_data.py` script creates the following mock datasets:

1. **User Preferences** (user_preferences.json):
   - 100 user profiles
   - Each profile includes: user_id, pitch, speed, accent, volume, and voice_gender

2. **Context Samples** (context_samples.json):
   - 1000 context scenarios
   - Each scenario includes: timestamp, user_id, location, device, activity, and ambient_noise level

3. **Sample Dialogues** (sample_dialogues.txt):
   - 1000 sample dialogue lines
   - These represent potential user queries or system responses

To generate this mock data, run:
```
python -m src.generate_mock_data
```

Note: The generated data files are not checked into the repository due to their size and the fact that they contain randomly generated data. Users should run the data generation script to create these files locally.

## Running the Project

1. Generate mock data (if not already done):
   ```
   python -m src.generate_mock_data
   ```

2. Run the speech synthesizer for a single interaction:
   ```
   python -m src.speech_synthesizer
   ```

3. Run the adaptive synthesizer to simulate multiple interactions:
   ```
   python -m src.adaptive_synthesizer
   ```

4. Evaluate the personalization system:
   ```
   python -m src.personalization_evaluation
   ```

## Project Outcomes

After running the scripts, you will find the following files in the `results/` directory:

1. **synthesized_speech.txt**: A text file containing the simulated personalized speech content.

2. **synthesized_speech.mp3**: An audio file of the synthesized speech with simulated personalization.

3. **synthesized_speech.wav**: Another audio file format of the synthesized speech.

The system outputs the personalization results and simulated user feedback to the console.

### Interpretation of Results

The console output demonstrates:
- Initial user preferences
- Context for each interaction
- Personalized speech content
- Simulated user satisfaction scores
- Adjustments made to user preferences based on the feedback

These outputs show the system's ability to adapt to user preferences over time.

## Scalability

While the current implementation uses a relatively small mock dataset for demonstration purposes, the code is designed to be scalable and can handle larger datasets in a production environment. Key scalability features include:

1. **Efficient Data Processing**: The system uses streaming and batch processing techniques that can handle large volumes of data.

2. **Modular Architecture**: Each component (user profiling, context analysis, speech synthesis) is designed as a separate module, allowing for easy scaling or replacement of individual components.

3. **Adaptive Learning**: The personalization algorithm is designed to continuously learn and adapt, making it suitable for long-term use with growing datasets.

4. **Extensible Data Model**: The user preference and context models can easily accommodate additional features without major code changes.

In a production environment, you would need to:
- Implement proper database systems for storing user profiles and context data.
- Set up distributed computing frameworks for handling multiple users simultaneously.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize the adaptation algorithms for better performance with large datasets.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement spectrogram generation for visual representation of the synthesized speech.
2. Create a JSON report file with detailed evaluation metrics.
3. Implement more sophisticated context analysis, possibly incorporating machine learning models.
4. Enhance the adaptation algorithm to more quickly identify and apply effective personalization strategies.
5. Integrate real speech synthesis with adjustable parameters for more accurate voice characteristic modifications.
6. Implement user feedback collection mechanisms for real-world testing and evaluation.
7. Explore reinforcement learning techniques for more effective long-term adaptation.

By continually refining the personalization algorithms and expanding the system's capabilities, we aim to create a voice assistant that provides a truly personalized and engaging user experience.
