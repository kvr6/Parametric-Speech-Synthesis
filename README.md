# Personalized Voice Assistant using Parametric Speech Synthesis

This project demonstrates an advanced approach to creating a personalized voice assistant using parametric speech synthesis techniques. It extends parametric speech techniques,initially studied during a Research Assistant internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, to create a personalized voice assistant. The system adapts voice characteristics (such as pitch, speed, and accent) based on individual user preferences and context. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits, the assistant optimizes voice parameters for each user, creating a highly personalized interaction experience.

Key features of the project include:
- User preference modeling for voice characteristics
- Context-aware adaptation of speech parameters
- Reinforcement learning for continuous improvement of personalization
- Scalable architecture designed to handle millions of user profiles

This work showcases the evolution from basic parametric speech synthesis to a sophisticated, personalized voice assistant system, demonstrating the practical application of academic research in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-voice-assistant.git
   cd personalized-voice-assistant
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preparation

The project uses mock datasets for demonstration purposes. These datasets are generated to simulate real-world data and are located in the `data/` directory:

| **Source**              | **Description**                                                   | **Path**                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Phoneme Formant Data**| Mock formant frequencies and bandwidths for different phonemes.   | `data/phoneme_formant_data.csv` |
| **User Preferences**    | Simulated user voice preferences for 100 users.                   | `data/user_preferences.json`   |
| **Context Samples**     | Mock context data for 1000 different scenarios.                   | `data/context_samples.json`    |
| **Sample Dialogues**    | Generated text corpus with 1000 sample dialogues.                 | `data/sample_dialogues.txt`    |

To generate the mock datasets, run:
```
python src/generate_mock_data.py
```

**Note**: These are mock datasets generated for illustration purposes. In a production environment, you would replace these with real user data and more comprehensive datasets.

## Results

(Description of where to find and how to interpret results will be added here)

## Scalability Considerations

While the provided code works with mock datasets, it has been designed with scalability in mind:

1. **Data Processing**: The code uses efficient data structures and streaming processing where possible to handle large datasets.
2. **User Profiles**: The system is designed to handle millions of user profiles by using appropriate database systems (not implemented in this mock version).
3. **Context Analysis**: The context analysis module can process real-time data streams for live context updates.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: The reinforcement learning algorithms are designed to work with online learning, allowing for continuous adaptation without retraining on the entire dataset.
5. **Distributed Processing**: While not implemented in this version, the architecture allows for distributed processing of voice synthesis tasks for improved performance at scale.

When implementing this system in a production environment, consider using cloud-based services for data storage and processing to ensure scalability and reliability.
