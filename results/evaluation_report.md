# Evaluation Report for Synthesized Speech

## 1. Overview

This report evaluates the synthesized speech generated from a parametric speech synthesis system. The evaluation covers quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, spectrogram comparison, and provides conclusions and recommendations based on the findings.

---

## 2. Quantitative Analysis

### 2.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

- **SNR**: 21.45 dB

**Interpretation**: The synthesized speech has a good signal-to-noise ratio, indicating that the signal is relatively clear compared to the noise level.

### 2.2 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

- **RMSE**: 0.0327

**Interpretation**: The RMSE value shows a low average error between the synthesized and reference waveforms, indicating good similarity in waveform structure.

### 2.3 Pearson Correlation

- **Correlation**: 0.78

**Interpretation**: A Pearson correlation of 0.78 suggests a strong relationship between the synthesized and reference waveforms, indicating that the synthesized speech closely follows the pattern of the reference speech.

## 3. Qualitative Analysis

### 3.1 Subjective Listening Test

**Method**: A group of listeners evaluated the naturalness and intelligibility of the synthesized speech compared to natural speech.

- **Naturalness Score**: 3.8 / 5.0
- **Intelligibility Score**: 4.2 / 5.0

**Comments**:
- Listeners noted that while the synthesized speech is generally intelligible, some phoneme transitions could be smoother.
- The naturalness is reasonably good, though there is room for improvement, particularly in prosody and expression.

### 3.2 Phoneme Accuracy

**Phoneme Confusion Matrix**: Refer to Appendix A for the detailed confusion matrix showing phoneme accuracy and common errors.

## 4. Spectrogram Analysis

### 4.1 Spectrogram Comparison

**Reference Spectrogram**:

**Synthesized Spectrogram**:

**Interpretation**:
- The synthesized spectrogram shows similar formant structures to the reference spectrogram.
- Some discrepancies in high-frequency content and formant transitions suggest areas for improvement in modeling dynamic phoneme changes.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### 5.1 Summary of Findings

- **Strengths**: The parametric synthesis system produces intelligible and reasonably natural speech with a good signal-to-noise ratio and low RMSE.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Enhancements can be made in modeling phoneme transitions and prosody to improve naturalness.

### 5.2 Recommendations

- **Phoneme Transition Modeling**: Refine the model for transitions between phonemes to reduce abrupt changes and improve smoothness.
- **Prosody Enhancement**: Incorporate prosody modeling to improve the expressiveness and natural rhythm of the speech.
- **Advanced Evaluation**: Implement more advanced evaluation metrics such as Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) for a more nuanced assessment.
